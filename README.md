# MATH-COMPUTATION PROJECT  

## Project Description
The "Math-Computation project" is a Java project designed to provide a set of classes for fundamental mathematical operations. Each class encapsulates a specific mathematical operation, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, rectangle perimeter calculation, triangle area calculation, circle area calculation, and circle perimeter calculation.

## Problem Statement
The project involves the creation of distinct classes, each responsible for a specific mathematical operation. Here's an overview of the classes and their functionalities:


1.	Addition Class

* Method: add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber)
* Returns the sum of two numbers.


2.	Subtraction Class:
   
* Method: subtract(int firstNumber, int secondNumber)
* Returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first.

3.	Multiplication Class:
	
*Method: multiply(int firstNumber, int secondNumber)
*Returns the product of two numbers.

4.	Division Class:
   
*Method: divide(double firstNumber, double secondNumber)
*Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second.

5.	Rectangle Perimeter Class:
   
*Method: calculatePerimeter(double length, double width)
*Returns the perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.

6.	Triangle Area Class:
   
*Method: calculateArea(double base, double perpendicularHeight)
*Returns the area of a triangle given its base and perpendicular height.

7.	Circle Area Class:
   
*Method: calculateArea(double radius)
*Returns the area of a circle given its radius.

8.	Circle Perimeter Class:
    
*Method: calculatePerimeter(double radius)
*Returns the perimeter of a circle given its radius.

The Main class will create objects of all these classes, the class will also prompt the user for inputs then output the specified operation. The switch statement is used to incorporate the menu feature into the project.
